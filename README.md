Project in Python and Keras : Left Ventricle Segmentation in Echocardiographic Imaging Using Neural Network

A Python 3 project for the analysis of 2D cardiac ultrasound images through the development of deep learning networks. 

The proposed framework is built on several libraries : 

- Keras (Tensorflow as backend)
- Scikit-learn & scikit-image
- Numpy & SciPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- SimpleITK & others built-in packages
